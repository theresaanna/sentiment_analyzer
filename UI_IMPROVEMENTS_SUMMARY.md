# UI Improvements and Bug Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Engagement Metrics Calculation**
**Problem:** The engagement metrics were showing incorrect values (all zeros for likes) because the code was looking for `like_count` field instead of the actual `likes` field returned by the YouTube API.

**Solution:** Updated `app/science/comment_summarizer.py`:
- Changed `c.get('like_count', 0)` to `c.get('likes', 0)` in the `_calculate_engagement_metrics` method
- Fixed both the total likes calculation and most liked comment detection

**Result:** 
- ✅ Total Likes on Comments: Now shows correct values (e.g., 1909 instead of 0)
- ✅ Average Likes per Comment: Now shows correct averages (e.g., 36.71 instead of 0)
- ✅ Most Liked Comment: Now shows correct like counts (e.g., 379 likes instead of 0)
- ✅ Reply Rate: Was already working correctly (e.g., 71.15%)

### 2. **Moved Comment Analysis Button**
**Problem:** The "Analyze Sentiment" button was in the Comment Analysis section header.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the button from the Comment Analysis section header
- Added the button to the Sentiment Analysis section header with proper styling

**Result:** The "Analyze Sentiment" button now appears in the Sentiment Analysis section header where it logically belongs.

### 3. **Removed Sentiment Distribution Cards**
**Problem:** User requested removal of the large sentiment distribution cards showing percentages.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the entire sentiment distribution cards section from the template
- Removed the associated JavaScript code that populated these cards
- Kept only the pie chart for sentiment visualization

**Result:** The bulky sentiment percentage cards (Positive %, Neutral %, Negative %) have been completely removed, making the interface cleaner.

### 4. **Removed Analysis Confidence Chart**
**Problem:** User requested removal of the "Analysis Confidence" chart section.

**Solution:**
- Removed the Analysis Confidence chart section from the template
- Removed the `createModelComparisonChart` JavaScript function completely
- Updated the charts row to show only the sentiment distribution pie chart (now full width)
- Removed the chart creation call from the main display function

**Result:** The Analysis Confidence chart with model comparisons has been completely removed, simplifying the visualization.

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes:

#### Engagement Metrics Fix:
```python
# Before (incorrect):
total_likes = sum(c.get('like_count', 0) for c in comments)
most_liked = max(comments, key=lambda c: c.get('like_count', 0))

# After (correct):
total_likes = sum(c.get('likes', 0) for c in comments)  
most_liked = max(comments, key=lambda c: c.get('likes', 0))
```

#### Template Structure Changes:
- Moved button from Comment Analysis header to Sentiment Analysis header
