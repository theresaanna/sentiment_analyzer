To be a rock star, you actually need to write good rock songs, and you have none. You are a pop star, not a rock star. I do recognize your talent and temperament your passion to create whatever you want to create, and show whatever you want to show, but you are not Freddy Mercury either Jim Morrison. Those are rock stars with actual rock songs and pretty good ones. So, with the songs that you have sold and 4 mil is absolutely nothing, who do you think you are just because you wear a purple wig? And guys who just sell crap, do get criticism, and you will get criticism as well no matter if you are a woman. No guy today of those oversexual Rap songs is a rock star, either are the females,  the last rock stars in the context of mainstream music were in the 90s.... after the only good decent songs are written by nightwish, those are rock stars. 
At worst you are a poor imitation of Madonna, and she also supported gays, and I support them as well, I mean today big deal! gays are recognized so much, they are considered the normal. 
You don't live in the 90s that you actually have to fight for something like that. So, in my opinion and harsh one, you don't sound real, you sound over your head and your actual value. So don't turn your failure writing some decent music into a feminist BS.","ok, let me correct you a little bit Lady Gaga because fame got you little bit in your head, no man just sitting there liking fast cars and all the stuff that your said doesn't get criticism for crappy music or oversexual music just like the ones you have.
