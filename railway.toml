# Service-specific configurations will be handled by Railway service settings
# Each service should have its own start command configured in Railway dashboard:
# - Web service: the gunicorn command from railway.json
# - Worker service: python analysis_worker.py
# IMPORTANT: Worker service must have healthcheck DISABLED in Railway dashboard
